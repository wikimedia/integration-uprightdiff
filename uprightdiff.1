uprightdiff \- examines the differences between two images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uprightdiff
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fI\,<input-1> <input-2> <output>\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
uprightdiff examines the differences between two images. It produces a visual annotation
and reports statistics.

It is optimised for images which come from browser screenshots. It analyses
the image for vertical motion, and annotates connected regions that have the
same vertical displacement. Then it highlights any remaining ("residual")
differences which are not explained by vertical motion on a pixel-by-pixel
basis.

.TP
\fB\-\-block\-size\fR arg
Block size for initial search (default 16)
.TP
\fB\-\-window\-size\fR arg
Initial range for vertical motion detection (default
200)
.TP
\fB\-\-brush\-width\fR arg
Brush width when heuristically expanding blocks. A
higher value gives smoother motion regions. This
should be an odd number. (default 9)
.TP
\fB\-\-outer\-hl\-window\fR arg
The size of the outer square used for detecting
isolated small features to highlight. This size
defines what we mean by "isolated". It should be an
odd number. (default 21)
.TP
\fB\-\-inner\-hl\-window\fR arg
The size of the inner square used for detecting
isolated small features to highlight. This size
defines what we mean by "small". It should be an odd
number. (default 5)
.TP
\fB\-\-intermediate\-dir\fR arg
A directory where intermediate images should be
placed. This is our equivalent of debug or trace
output.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR [ \fB\-\-verbose\fR ]
Write progress info to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-\-format\fR arg
The output format for statistics, may be text (the
default), json or none.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR [ \fB\-\-log\-timestamp\fR ]
Annotate progress info with elapsed time.
